# 🔧 Resolving Failed Migrations in Production

## The Problem
The deployment is failing because of **MULTIPLE failed migrations** that are blocking new migrations from being applied. This is a cascading failure pattern:

1. `20250805183315_add_encrypted_data_tables` - Failed during previous deployment ✅ **RESOLVED**
2. `20250815073301_init_after_reset` - Failed because it's trying to add columns that already exist
3. `20250815081729_add_stripe_subscription_models` - Failed because tables already exist
4. `20250815081800_add_stripe_user_fields` - Failed because fields already exist
5. **And potentially more...**

## The Solution
We need to mark **ALL failed migrations** as resolved in production so that new migrations can be applied.

## 🚀 **QUICK FIX: Use the Comprehensive Script (Recommended)**

### **Option 1: Run the Comprehensive Script**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your backend service
3. Click on "Console" tab
4. Run this single command:

```bash
node scripts/resolve-all-remaining-migrations.js
```

This script will automatically resolve ALL remaining failed migrations!

### **Option 2: Manual Resolution (One by One)**

#### **Step 1: Resolve init_after_reset migration**
```bash
# Create temporary migration file
mkdir -p prisma/migrations/20250815073301_init_after_reset
echo "-- Temporary migration for resolution" > prisma/migrations/20250815073301_init_after_reset/migration.sql
echo "-- This migration is redundant - columns already exist" >> prisma/migrations/20250815073301_init_after_reset/migration.sql
echo "-- algorithm, iv, keyVersion, and tag columns are already in the table" >> prisma/migrations/20250815073301_init_after_reset/migration.sql

# Mark migration as resolved
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20250815073301_init_after_reset

# Clean up
rm -rf prisma/migrations/20250815073301_init_after_reset
```

#### **Step 2: Resolve Stripe subscription models migration**
```bash
# Create temporary migration file
mkdir -p prisma/migrations/20250815081729_add_stripe_subscription_models
echo "-- Temporary migration for resolution" > prisma/migrations/20250815081729_add_stripe_subscription_models/migration.sql
echo "-- This migration is redundant - tables already exist" >> prisma/migrations/20250815081729_add_stripe_subscription_models/migration.sql
echo "-- subscription_events and subscriptions tables are already in the schema" >> prisma/migrations/20250815081729_add_stripe_subscription_models/migration.sql

# Mark migration as resolved
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20250815081729_add_stripe_subscription_models

# Clean up
rm -rf prisma/migrations/20250815081729_add_stripe_subscription_models
```

#### **Step 3: Resolve Stripe user fields migration**
```bash
# Create temporary migration file
mkdir -p prisma/migrations/20250815081800_add_stripe_user_fields
echo "-- Temporary migration for resolution" > prisma/migrations/20250815081800_add_stripe_user_fields/migration.sql
echo "-- This migration is redundant - fields already exist" >> prisma/migrations/20250815081800_add_stripe_user_fields/migration.sql
echo "-- Stripe user fields are already in the User model" >> prisma/migrations/20250815081800_add_stripe_user_fields/migration.sql

# Mark migration as resolved
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20250815081800_add_stripe_user_fields

# Clean up
rm -rf prisma/migrations/20250815081800_add_stripe_user_fields

# Verify all are resolved
npx prisma migrate status
```

## What This Does
1. Creates temporary migration files that match the failed migrations
2. Marks ALL migrations as "applied" in the database
3. Cleans up the temporary files
4. Allows new migrations to proceed

## After Resolution
Once ALL migrations are resolved:
1. Commit and push the script changes
2. Redeploy - the migrations should now succeed
3. New migrations will be applied normally

## Why This Happened
- **Cascading failure**: Once one migration fails, all subsequent ones fail
- **Redundant migrations**: These migrations are trying to create structures that already exist
- **Schema drift**: Local schema got ahead of production database state
- Prisma won't apply new migrations until ALL failed ones are resolved

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Use the Comprehensive Script!
The comprehensive script will resolve ALL remaining migrations automatically. This is much faster and safer than doing them one by one.

## 🎯 **Expected Result**
After running the comprehensive script:
- ✅ ALL failed migrations will be resolved
- ✅ New deployments will succeed
- ✅ Your app will be back online!

**Use the comprehensive script: `node scripts/resolve-all-remaining-migrations.js`** 🚀
