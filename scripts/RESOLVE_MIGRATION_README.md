# ðŸ”§ Resolving Failed Migration in Production

## The Problem
The deployment is failing because of a failed migration `20250805183315_add_encrypted_data_tables` that's still marked as failed in the production database.

## The Solution
We need to mark this migration as resolved in production so that new migrations can be applied.

## Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Run Script in Render Console (Recommended)
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your backend service
3. Click on "Console" tab
4. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Check current migration status
npx prisma migrate status

# Create temporary migration file
mkdir -p prisma/migrations/20250805183315_add_encrypted_data_tables
echo "-- Temporary migration for resolution" > prisma/migrations/20250805183315_add_encrypted_data_tables/migration.sql
echo "-- This migration already exists in production" >> prisma/migrations/20250805183315_add_encrypted_data_tables/migration.sql
echo "-- Tables were created manually after the failed migration" >> prisma/migrations/20250805183315_add_encrypted_data_tables/migration.sql

# Mark migration as resolved
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20250805183315_add_encrypted_data_tables

# Clean up
rm -rf prisma/migrations/20250805183315_add_encrypted_data_tables

# Verify it's resolved
npx prisma migrate status
```

### Option 2: Use the Script
If you prefer, you can also run the provided script:

```bash
node scripts/resolve-encrypted-data-migration-simple.js
```

## What This Does
1. Creates a temporary migration file that matches the failed migration
2. Marks the migration as "applied" in the database
3. Cleans up the temporary file
4. Allows new migrations to proceed

## After Resolution
Once the migration is resolved:
1. Commit and push the script changes
2. Redeploy - the migration should now succeed
3. New migrations will be applied normally

## Why This Happened
- The migration file was created locally
- It failed during production deployment
- The database marked it as failed
- Prisma won't apply new migrations until failed ones are resolved
- Since the tables already exist, we just need to mark it as resolved
