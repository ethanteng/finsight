#### **Adding More Financial Products**

**Secondary File:** `src/data/providers/search.ts` (Lines 249-260)

**Current Financial Keywords:**
```typescript
const financialKeywords = [
  'mortgage rates', 'CD rates', 'savings rates', 'investment advice',
  'retirement planning', 'tax strategies', 'budgeting tips',
  'credit card rates', 'loan rates', 'financial planning'
];
```

**To Add More Products:**
1. **Edit the array** in `src/data/providers/search.ts` around line 249
2. **Add product keywords** that should trigger enhanced search
3. **Test with integration tests**

**Example Expansion:**
```typescript
const financialKeywords = [
  'mortgage rates', 'CD rates', 'savings rates', 'investment advice',
  'retirement planning', 'tax strategies', 'budgeting tips',
  'credit card rates', 'loan rates', 'financial planning',
  'auto loan rate', 'personal loan rate', 'student loan rate',
  'home equity rate', 'heloc rate', 'money market rate',
  'investment account rate', 'ira rate', '401k rate', 'annuity rate'
];
```

#### **How Enhanced Context Works**

When users ask questions mentioning supported institutions or products:

1. **Institution Detection**: System identifies mentioned financial institutions
2. **Query Enhancement**: Automatically adds "current rates today 2025" for rate questions
3. **Search Optimization**: Enhances search queries for better results
4. **Real-Time Data**: Provides current information from multiple sources
5. **Source Attribution**: Transparently cites information sources

#### **Testing Changes**

After making changes:
```bash
# Run integration tests to ensure stability
npm run test:integration

# Test specific enhanced context functionality
npm run test:integration -- src/__tests__/integration/enhanced-market-context-api.test.ts
```
