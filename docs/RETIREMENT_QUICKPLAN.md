# Retirement quick plan (`/retirement-calculator`)

Status: **landing-page experiment**

A public, unauthenticated page that runs the real retirement engine against six
numbers a visitor types in. It is a test of one hypothesis: that a
decision-specific calculation from Ask Linc's own infrastructure converts better
than a chat box with no data behind it.

There is deliberately **no chat input anywhere on the page**. A visitor enters a
plan and gets the deterministic engine's output — charts, scenarios, and the
list of everything the model had to assume on their behalf.

## Pieces

| Piece | Path |
|---|---|
| Page | `frontend/src/app/retirement-calculator/page.tsx` |
| Client component | `frontend/src/components/marketing/RetirementQuickPlan.tsx` |
| Styles | `frontend/src/components/marketing/retirement-quickplan.css` |
| Service | `src/services/retirement-quickplan.ts` |
| Route | `src/routes/retirement-quickplan.ts` (mounted at `/api/retirement-quickplan`) |
| Tests | `src/__tests__/unit/retirement-quickplan.test.ts` |

## What it runs

`runRetirementQuickPlan` calls `analyzeRetirementPortfolio` — the same entry
point `src/openai/context-service.ts` uses for authenticated answers — four
times: the plan as entered, the same plan retiring two and five years later, and
the same plan spending 10% less. Nothing about the calculation is special-cased
for the landing page.

Inputs are the six numbers the page asks for (current age, retirement age,
investable assets, annual spending, annual contributions, Social Security),
plus a claiming age and one of three asset-mix presets.

## Deliberate choices

**No provider lookups.** The synthetic portfolio carries no ticker symbols, so
the classifier resolves it from declared type and name alone. A request touches
no database and no external API; the historical returns are a checked-in CSV.
A request is pure CPU.

**US-only presets.** Every preset is US stocks, US government bonds and cash,
with no international sleeve. The engine only builds sequences over months where
every series it needs exists, and this dataset's international series starts in
1975 — so an international sleeve limits the test to retirements beginning
between 1975 and the early 1980s, which returns a near-100% survival rate for
almost any plan. Dropping it buys back 1926 onward, including the 1929, 1937,
1966 and 1973 starts. For a portfolio the visitor has not actually told us
about, the longer and harsher record is the more useful one. The page states
this trade in its limitations list.

**Social Security is modeled, not netted.** `RetirementAnalysisInput` gained an
optional `retirementIncome` stream, wired through `simulateWithdrawals` as an
`incomeOffset`. It reduces the portfolio withdrawal from its own start age,
indexed by each sequence's CPI, floored at zero — so a visitor who retires at 60
and claims at 67 correctly funds those seven years entirely from the portfolio,
which is exactly the stretch sequence risk punishes. Netting the benefit across
the whole retirement would have hidden that. Existing callers pass nothing and
are unaffected.

**Metrics the page does not show.** The engine's `metrics.withdrawalRate` and
`yearsOfExpenses` describe gross spending against the portfolio and are not the
net draw once an income offset starts, so the page derives its own first-year
figures. `stressTest.worstSequences.byDrawdown` measures the portfolio path
*including withdrawals*, so a depleted sequence reports a ~100% "drawdown"; on a
page with no room to explain that it would read as a market crash, so the
service drops it.

**The limitations list is content, not fine print.** It is rendered full-width
on a dark section directly under the charts, because the gap between six numbers
and real accounts is the reason to connect real accounts.

## Operational notes

- Rate limited per IP: `RETIREMENT_QUICKPLAN_RATE_LIMIT` requests per minute
  (default 20).
- Results are deterministic given the normalized inputs and the checked-in
  dataset, so they are cached in-process (bounded at 500 entries, cleared on
  restart — which is also when a new dataset would ship).
- Variants run sequentially with a `setImmediate` yield between them. Each run
  is a few hundred milliseconds of straight CPU, and fusing them into one block
  would stall every other request behind it.
- Analytics: the page pushes a `retirement_model_run` dataLayer event. GTM needs
  a Custom Event trigger and a GA4 tag for it, or the push goes nowhere.
