# 🧠 RAG System & Intelligent Profile Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system and **Intelligent Profile** integration that provides tier-based access to real-time financial data and personalized AI responses.

## 🎯 System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **RAG System**: Retrieves real-time financial data via Brave Search API
2. **Intelligent Profile System**: Builds and maintains user profiles for personalized advice
3. **Tier-Aware Context**: Provides different data access levels based on subscription tier
4. **System Prompt Integration**: Combines RAG data and user profiles in AI prompts

### Data Flow

```
User Question → Tier Check → RAG Retrieval → Profile Retrieval → System Prompt → AI Response
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior by Tier

### Starter Tier
- **RAG Access**: ❌ No real-time financial data
- **Profile Access**: ✅ Full Intelligent Profile integration
- **Limitations**: Shows tier limitations and upgrade suggestions
- **Response Style**: Personalized advice based on user profile, but no real-time data

**Example Response:**
```
I'm unable to access real-time economic data like the current unemployment rate due to your current subscription tier. However, I can help you analyze your financial situation and provide personalized advice based on your profile...
```

### Standard Tier
- **RAG Access**: ✅ Real-time financial data via Brave Search
- **Profile Access**: ✅ Full Intelligent Profile integration
- **Limitations**: No tier limitations when RAG data is available
- **Response Style**: Real-time data + personalized advice

**Example Response:**
```
The current unemployment rate in the United States is 4.2% as of July 2025. This rate has increased slightly from 4.1% in June 2025. Based on your financial profile and current situation...
```

### Premium Tier
- **RAG Access**: ✅ Real-time financial data via Brave Search
- **Profile Access**: ✅ Full Intelligent Profile integration
- **Limitations**: No tier limitations (full access)
- **Response Style**: Real-time data + personalized advice + enhanced market context

**Example Response:**
```
As of today, August 4, 2025, the average mortgage rates are as follows:
- The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is approximately 6.72%
Based on your current financial situation and the latest financial data, here's a suggested approach...
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### RAG System Integration

#### System Prompt Format
```typescript
=== REAL-TIME FINANCIAL DATA ===
{searchContext}
=== END REAL-TIME FINANCIAL DATA ===

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST use the information between the === REAL-TIME FINANCIAL DATA === markers
- Do NOT say you lack access to real-time data when the answer is present above
- When the user asks about rates, prices, or current information, use the specific data from the search results above
- Provide the current information from the search results directly
- If the search results contain the answer, use that information instead of your training data
```

#### Search Context Retrieval
- **Standard & Premium**: Enhanced search queries with current date/time keywords
- **Starter**: No search context retrieved
- **Caching**: Search results cached to prevent rate limiting

### Intelligent Profile Integration

#### Profile Data Structure
```typescript
USER PROFILE:
{userProfile}

Use this profile information to provide more personalized and relevant financial advice.
Consider the user's personal situation, family status, occupation, and financial goals when making recommendations.
```

#### Profile Management
- **Retrieval**: `ProfileManager.getOrCreateProfile(userId)`
- **Updates**: Automatic profile updates after each conversation
- **Scope**: Available for all tiers (Starter, Standard, Premium)
- **Demo Mode**: Profiles disabled in demo mode

### Tier-Aware System Prompts

#### Function Signatures
```typescript
function buildEnhancedSystemPrompt(
  tierContext: TierAwareContext, 
  accountSummary: string, 
  transactionSummary: string,
  marketContextSummary: string,
  searchContext?: string,
  userProfile?: string
): string

function buildTierAwareSystemPrompt(
  tierContext: TierAwareContext, 
  accountSummary: string, 
  transactionSummary: string,
  searchContext?: string,
  userProfile?: string
): string
```

#### Conditional Logic
- **RAG Data**: Only included for Standard and Premium tiers
- **Profile Data**: Included for all tiers when available
- **Limitations**: Only shown when no RAG data is available
- **Upgrade Suggestions**: Only shown when no RAG data is available
