# Prompt Formatting Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to address excessive highlighting and formatting in financial analysis responses from the AI system.

## Problems Identified
Based on the examples provided, the financial analysis outputs had several formatting issues:

1. **Too much highlighting** - Almost every key phrase was highlighted in blue, creating visual noise
2. **Inconsistent formatting** - Some sections used bold, others used highlighting, others used plain text
3. **Poor visual hierarchy** - Hard to distinguish between different levels of information
4. **Overwhelming structure** - Too many bullet points and nested lists

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt Instructions
Updated the system prompt in `src/openai.ts` to include specific formatting guidelines:

#### Response Formatting Rules
- Use **bold** only for main section headers (e.g., "**Financial Overview**", "**Recommendations**")
- Use *italics* sparingly for sub-section headers only when needed
- Use bullet points (- ) for lists, keeping bullet and text on same line
- Use numbered lists (1. 2. 3.) for steps or rankings
- Use ## for major section headers
- Keep paragraphs concise with single line breaks between them
- Format numbers and percentages clearly
- Make the response clean and professional
- Avoid excessive blank lines between list items
- Be conversational but professional

#### Important Formatting Rules
- **NEVER highlight or bold descriptive text or common phrases**
- **ONLY highlight 2-3 critical numbers per section** (e.g., total amounts, key percentages)
- **Use simple, clean structure** - avoid nested bullet points when possible
- **Group related information together** in simple formats
- **Limit each section to 3-4 key points** for readability
- **Use consistent formatting** for similar types of data throughout the response
- **Avoid repetitive formatting patterns** that create visual noise

### 2. Calculation Formatting Improvements
Updated calculation formatting to be cleaner and less visually overwhelming:

- For financial calculations, use clear step-by-step breakdowns
- Display mathematical formulas in simple text format for clarity
- Use **bold** only for final calculated values and key percentages
- Show intermediate calculation steps clearly but concisely
- Format currency values consistently: $X,XXX.XX
- Format percentages with 2 decimal places when appropriate (e.g., 15.67%)

#### Calculation Formatting Rules
- **Keep calculations simple and readable** - avoid excessive formatting
- **Use consistent spacing** between calculation steps
- **Highlight only the final result** in bold, not intermediate steps
- **Group related calculations together** in logical sections
- **Avoid nested formatting** that creates visual complexity

### 3. Visual Calculation Enhancements
Simplified the visual calculation structure:

- Use "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc. for clear calculation structure
- Include "Verification:" text for calculation verification
- Use mathematical expressions with = signs and currency/percentage symbols
- Structure debt-to-income calculations simply and clearly

#### Enhancement Rules
- **Keep formatting simple and consistent** throughout calculations
- **Use clear step labels** but avoid excessive formatting
- **Maintain readable spacing** between calculation sections
- **Focus on clarity** rather than visual complexity

## Expected Results

With these improvements, financial analysis responses should now:

1. **Have minimal highlighting** - Only 2-3 critical numbers per section will be highlighted
2. **Use consistent formatting** - Main headers in bold, sub-headers in italics when needed
3. **Maintain clean structure** - Simple bullet points and logical grouping
4. **Focus on readability** - Clear information hierarchy without visual noise
5. **Provide actionable insights** - Clean, professional presentation that's easy to scan

## Implementation Notes

- The improvements focus on **prevention** through better system prompt instructions rather than post-processing
- The existing `formatResponseWithRegex` function handles basic formatting cleanup (spacing, line breaks, etc.)
- The system prompt now includes specific examples and rules to guide the AI's output formatting
- All changes maintain backward compatibility while improving output quality

## Testing

The improvements have been tested to ensure:
- Basic formatting functions continue to work correctly
- System prompt changes are properly applied
- No regressions in existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

Consider these additional improvements for future iterations:

1. **Template-based formatting** - Create specific templates for different types of financial analysis
2. **Dynamic formatting rules** - Allow users to customize formatting preferences
3. **Visual consistency checks** - Add validation to ensure formatting rules are followed
4. **Formatting analytics** - Track and analyze formatting quality over time
