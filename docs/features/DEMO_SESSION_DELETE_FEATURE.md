# Demo Session Delete Feature

## Overview

This feature allows administrators to delete demo sessions from the admin dashboard, which will also remove all associated conversations. This is useful for cleaning up test sessions while preserving sessions created by actual users.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **New API Endpoint**: `DELETE /admin/demo-sessions/:sessionId`
   - Location: `src/index.ts` (lines ~1470-1500)
   - Requires admin authentication
   - Deletes the demo session and all associated conversations via cascade delete

2. **Database Schema Update**: 
   - Added `onDelete: Cascade` to the `DemoConversation.sessionId` relation
   - Migration: `20250817084942_add_cascade_delete_to_demo_conversations`
   - This ensures that when a demo session is deleted, all its conversations are automatically removed

### Frontend Changes

1. **Admin Page Updates**: `frontend/src/app/admin/page.tsx`
   - Added delete button to each demo session in the "Sessions Overview" view
   - Added confirmation modal before deletion
   - Added state management for delete operations
   - Automatic refresh of data after successful deletion

2. **New State Variables**:
   - `deletingSession`: Tracks which session is currently being deleted
   - `showDeleteSessionConfirm`: Controls the confirmation modal display

3. **New Functions**:
   - `deleteDemoSession()`: Handles the HTTP delete request and UI updates

## User Experience

### How to Use

1. Navigate to `/admin` page
2. Click on the "Demo" tab
3. In "Sessions Overview" view, each session now has a "Delete Session" button
4. Click the delete button to open a confirmation modal
5. Confirm deletion to remove the session and all its conversations
6. The admin page automatically refreshes to show updated data

### Safety Features

- **Confirmation Modal**: Users must confirm before deletion
- **Clear Warning**: Shows how many conversations will be deleted
- **Irreversible Action**: Clearly states that deletion cannot be undone
- **Admin Only**: Requires admin authentication to access

## Technical Benefits

1. **Cascade Delete**: Automatically removes all related data when a session is deleted
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevents orphaned conversations
3. **Performance**: Single database operation removes all related records
4. **Real-time Updates**: UI immediately reflects changes after deletion

## Testing

The feature has been tested with:
- Database cascade delete functionality
- Frontend state management
- API endpoint functionality
- Error handling for non-existent sessions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Bulk delete multiple sessions
- Filtering sessions by date range before deletion
- Soft delete (mark as deleted but keep data for audit)
- Deletion history/logging
- Undo functionality within a time window

## Security Considerations

- Only accessible to authenticated admin users
- Validates session existence before deletion
- Uses proper HTTP methods (DELETE)
- Maintains audit trail through existing logging
