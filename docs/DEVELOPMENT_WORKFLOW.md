# üöÄ Development Workflow Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow for the Finsight project, including best practices for feature development, testing, and deployment to prevent common issues like schema drift.

## üèóÔ∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- Git
- Prisma CLI

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ethanteng/finsight.git
cd finsight

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database URL and API keys

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

## üîÑ Feature Development Workflow

### 1. Start New Feature
```bash
# Ensure you're on clean main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Sync with production schema (CRITICAL!)
npx prisma db pull
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Database Schema Changes

#### ‚úÖ Correct Approach:
```bash
# 1. Edit schema.prisma
# 2. Create migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_migration_name

# 3. Test migration locally
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 4. Commit everything
git add prisma/
git commit -m "feat: add UserProfile model with proper migrations"
```

#### ‚ùå Never Do This:
```bash
# DON'T: Use db push in production
npx prisma db push

# DON'T: Modify database directly
# DON'T: Skip migration files
# DON'T: Forget to commit migration files
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Migration Order & Deployment Sequence

**This is the #1 cause of production schema drift and deployment failures.**

#### üö® The Golden Rule: Schema First, Code Second

**‚ùå WRONG ORDER (Causes Schema Drift):**
```bash
# 1. Deploy code that expects new schema
git push origin main  # Code deployed with new expectations

# 2. Database still has old schema
# 3. Code fails with "Column 'xyz' does not exist"
# 4. Emergency manual intervention required
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT ORDER (Prevents Schema Drift):**
```bash
# 1. Create and test migration locally
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_new_columns
npx prisma migrate reset  # Test full migration cycle
npx prisma migrate deploy  # Verify deployment works

# 2. Commit migration files WITH code changes
git add prisma/migrations/
git add src/
git commit -m "feat: add new columns + migration"
git push origin main

# 3. CI/CD handles the rest
# - Code deployment happens
# - npx prisma migrate deploy runs automatically
# - Database schema updated
# - Everything works!
```

#### üîç Migration Validation Checklist

**Before ANY deployment, verify:**

```bash
# 1. Check migration status
npx prisma migrate status
# Should show: "Database schema is up to date"

# 2. Preview what will happen in production
npx prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature
# Should show: "No pending migrations to apply"

# 3. Verify schema matches locally
npx prisma db pull
npx prisma generate
# Should show: "No changes detected"

# 4. Test migration locally
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate deploy
# Should complete without errors
```

#### üö® Common Schema Drift Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Deployed Code Before Migration**
```bash
# ‚ùå What happened to us:
1. Updated schema.prisma locally
2. Deployed code expecting new columns
3. Production database still had old schema
4. Result: "Column 'iv' does not exist" errors

# ‚úÖ How to prevent:
1. ALWAYS test migrations locally first
2. NEVER deploy code before migration is ready
3. Commit migration files with code changes
```

**Scenario 2: Missing Migration Files**
```bash
# ‚ùå What causes this:
1. Used `npx prisma db push` instead of migrations
2. Forgot to commit migration files
3. Production database schema differs from local

# ‚úÖ How to prevent:
1. ALWAYS use `npx prisma migrate dev`
2. ALWAYS commit migration files
3. NEVER use `db push` in production
```

**Scenario 3: Incomplete Migration Testing**
```bash
# ‚ùå What causes this:
1. Created migration but didn't test it
2. Assumed migration would work in production
3. Production migration fails

# ‚úÖ How to prevent:
1. ALWAYS test full migration cycle locally
2. Use `npx prisma migrate reset` to test from scratch
3. Verify migration works before committing
```

#### üõ°Ô∏è Deployment Safety Measures

**Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] **Migration created and tested locally** ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Migration files committed to git** ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Local migration reset/deploy tested** ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Schema status shows "up to date"** ‚úÖ
- [ ] **No pending migrations detected** ‚úÖ
- [ ] **All tests passing with new schema** ‚úÖ

**Emergency Recovery (If Schema Drift Occurs):**
```bash
# 1. Identify the drift
npx prisma migrate status
npx prisma db pull

# 2. Apply missing migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 3. If manual intervention needed:
npx prisma db execute --stdin --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma
# Paste SQL commands manually

# 4. Regenerate client
npx prisma generate

# 5. Clear build cache and redeploy
```

### 3. Development Process
```bash
# Make your changes
# Write tests
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user profile functionality"

# Push to feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Before Merging
```bash
# Test everything locally
npm run test:all
npm run build

# Check migration status
npx prisma migrate status

# Preview migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature
```

## üé≠ DEMO Mode Development - SEPARATE FROM CORE APP

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: DEMO Mode is Completely Separate

**DEMO mode should NEVER be mixed with core app development or debugging. When developing features, focus ONLY on the core application.**

#### ‚úÖ Correct Development Approach:
```bash
# For core app development (production mode)
npm run dev:production

# Focus ONLY on:
# - Core app functionality
# - Production features
# - Real user workflows
# - Production data handling
# - Core app testing

# DO NOT:
# - Compare DEMO vs production behavior
# - "Fix" DEMO mode during core development
# - Mix DEMO and production logic
# - Update DEMO data structures
```

#### ‚ùå Never Do This During Core Development:
```bash
# DON'T: Try to "fix" DEMO mode while developing core features
# DON'T: Compare DEMO behavior with production behavior
# DON'T: Update DEMO data or components during core development
# DON'T: Mix DEMO and production debugging
# DON'T: Use DEMO mode to test production features
```

#### üîÑ DEMO Mode Development Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Complete core app development FIRST
# 2. Test core functionality thoroughly
# 3. Commit and merge core changes
# 4. ONLY THEN: Switch to DEMO mode development

# For DEMO mode development (separate task):
npm run dev:sandbox  # or appropriate DEMO mode command

# Focus ONLY on:
# - DEMO data structures
# - DEMO user experience
# - DEMO testing scenarios
# - DEMO mode specific features
```

#### üìã Development Priority Order:
1. **Core App Development** (production mode)
   - Implement new features
   - Fix production bugs
   - Test core functionality
   - Deploy to production

2. **DEMO Mode Updates** (separate task)
   - Update DEMO data structures
   - Enhance DEMO user experience
   - Test DEMO scenarios
   - Deploy DEMO improvements

#### üö´ Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- **"Let me check if this works in DEMO mode too"** - NO! Focus on core app first
- **"I need to fix DEMO mode while I'm here"** - NO! Separate task
- **"Let me compare DEMO vs production behavior"** - NO! One at a time
- **"I'll update DEMO data while developing this feature"** - NO! Sequential development

#### üí° Why This Separation Matters:
- **Prevents confusion** between DEMO and production logic
- **Faster development** by focusing on one thing at a time
- **Cleaner commits** with clear separation of concerns
- **Easier debugging** without cross-contamination
- **Better testing** of each mode independently

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Management

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Preventing Schema Drift

Schema drift occurs when local and production database schemas become out of sync, causing deployment failures.

#### Common Causes:
1. **Direct database modifications** without migrations
2. **Using `prisma db push`** instead of proper migrations
3. **Incomplete git history** of schema changes
4. **Feature branch development** without proper schema sync
5. **Manual SQL modifications** to production database

#### Prevention Checklist:
- [ ] **Before feature development**: `npx prisma db pull`
- [ ] **Schema changes**: Always use `npx prisma migrate dev`
- [ ] **Test migrations**: `npx prisma migrate reset && npx prisma migrate deploy`
- [ ] **Commit migrations**: Always commit migration files to git
- [ ] **Before deployment**: `npx prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature`
- [ ] **Monitor deployments**: Check migration logs for failures

#### Schema Drift Recovery:
If schema drift occurs (like the 2025-08-05 incident):

1. **Identify the drift:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate status
   npx prisma db pull
   ```

2. **Create conditional migrations** for missing columns:
   ```sql
   -- Example: Safe column addition
   DO $$
   BEGIN
       IF NOT EXISTS (
           SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
           WHERE table_name = 'user_profiles' 
           AND column_name = 'email'
       ) THEN
           ALTER TABLE "user_profiles" ADD COLUMN "email" TEXT;
       END IF;
   END $$;
   ```

3. **Never use `prisma db push`** in production
4. **Always test migrations** before deploying

## üß™ Testing Workflow

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# All tests
npm run test:all

# Coverage
npm run test:coverage:all
```

### Test Best Practices
- Write tests for new features
- Maintain 80% coverage threshold
- Test database operations with proper cleanup
- Mock external API calls
- Use realistic test data

## üîí CI/CD API Safety

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: API Key Safety in CI/CD

**Problem**: CI/CD integration tests were previously using real API keys (`FRED_API_KEY_REAL`, `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY_REAL`) which could hit live API endpoints.

**Solution**: Updated GitHub Actions workflow and all providers to use test API keys for all test environments.

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Measures in Place

#### 1. **Multiple Layers of Protection**
- GitHub Actions environment variables (test keys only)
- Provider-level API key validation
- Environment detection (`NODE_ENV === 'test'`)
- CI/CD detection (`process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS`)
- Comprehensive Jest mocking for all external APIs
- Module-level safety checks

#### 2. **Environment Isolation**
- **Test environment**: Uses `test_*` keys
- **CI/CD environment**: Uses `test_*` keys  
- **Production environment**: Uses real keys (only on Render)
- **Development environment**: Uses real keys (only on localhost)

#### 3. **What This Prevents**
- ‚ùå Real FRED API calls in CI/CD
- ‚ùå Real Alpha Vantage API calls in CI/CD
- ‚ùå Real Search API calls in CI/CD
- ‚ùå Real Polygon.io API calls in CI/CD
- ‚ùå Real OpenAI API calls in CI/CD
- ‚ùå Real Plaid API calls in CI/CD
- ‚ùå Any accidental real API usage during testing

### üîß Implementation Details

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# SAFE: All tests use test API keys
FRED_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FRED_API_KEY }}
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY }}
```

#### Provider-Level Safety Checks
```typescript
// Example: FRED Provider safety check
if (this.apiKey === 'test_fred_key' || 
    this.apiKey.startsWith('test_') || 
    process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS) {
  // Return mock data, no real API calls
}
```

#### Comprehensive Mocking
```typescript
// Integration test setup mocks all external APIs
jest.mock('../../openai', () => ({
  askOpenAI: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('Mocked AI response'),
  // ... other mocks
}));
```

### üìã Verification Steps

To verify these changes work:

1. **Run tests locally**: `npm run test:unit && npm run test:integration`
2. **Check CI/CD logs**: Ensure no real API calls are made
3. **Verify mock data**: Confirm tests receive expected mock responses
4. **Monitor API usage**: Check that no real API endpoints are hit

### üöÄ Deployment Safety

These changes are safe to deploy immediately as they:
- Don't affect production functionality
- Only change test/CI behavior
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Improve security and reliability

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing locally
- [ ] **Migration created and tested locally** ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Full migration cycle tested** (reset + deploy) ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Migration files committed to git** ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Schema status shows "up to date"** ‚úÖ
- [ ] **No pending migrations detected** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Migrations tested with `--preview-feature`
- [ ] Schema synced with production
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Environment variables configured

### Deployment Process
```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin main

# CI/CD will automatically:
# 1. Run tests
# 2. Apply migrations (CRITICAL: This happens BEFORE code deployment)
# 3. Deploy to production
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Deployment Order Matters

**The CI/CD pipeline follows this exact sequence:**
1. **Tests run** - Ensure code quality
2. **Migrations applied** - Update database schema FIRST
3. **Code deployed** - Deploy code that expects new schema

**This is why committing migration files is critical:**
- Migration files tell CI/CD what schema changes to apply
- Without migration files, CI/CD can't update the schema
- Code deployment fails because schema doesn't match expectations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Migration Failures
```bash
# Check migration status
npx prisma migrate status

# Reset local database
npx prisma migrate reset

# Sync with production
npx prisma db pull
```

#### Schema Drift
```bash
# Identify differences
npx prisma db pull
npx prisma migrate status

# Create conditional migrations
# See Schema Drift Recovery section above
```

#### Test Failures
```bash
# Clear test cache
npm run test:unit -- --clearCache

# Check database connection
npx prisma db push --preview-feature

# Verify environment variables
echo $DATABASE_URL
```

## üö® **Schema Drift Prevention - Real Examples**

### **Example 1: The Profile Encryption Incident (August 2025)**

**What Happened:**
We experienced a critical schema drift issue when implementing profile encryption at rest. Here's the exact sequence that caused the problem:

#### **‚ùå The Wrong Sequence (What We Did)**

```bash
# 1. Updated schema.prisma locally
# Added: iv, tag, keyVersion, algorithm columns to encrypted_profile_data

# 2. Created migration file
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_encryption_columns_to_profile_data

# 3. ‚ùå DEPLOYED CODE BEFORE MIGRATION
git push origin main  # Code deployed expecting new columns

# 4. ‚ùå Production database still had old schema
# - Code expected: iv, tag, keyVersion, algorithm columns
# - Database had: Only encryptedData column
# - Result: "Column 'iv' does not exist" errors
```

#### **‚úÖ The Correct Sequence (What We Should Have Done)**

```bash
# 1. Updated schema.prisma locally
# Added: iv, tag, keyVersion, algorithm columns

# 2. Created migration file
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_encryption_columns_to_profile_data

# 3. ‚úÖ TESTED MIGRATION LOCALLY FIRST
npx prisma migrate reset  # Test from scratch
npx prisma migrate deploy  # Verify it works

# 4. ‚úÖ COMMITTED MIGRATION FILES WITH CODE
git add prisma/migrations/
git add src/
git commit -m "feat: add encryption columns + migration"
git push origin main

# 5. ‚úÖ CI/CD would have handled migration automatically
# - Code deployment
# - npx prisma migrate deploy
# - Database schema updated
# - Everything works!
```

### **Example 2: The Stripe Integration Incident (August 2025)**

**What Happened:**
We experienced a critical schema drift issue when working on Stripe subscription integration in a feature branch. Here's exactly how it happened:

#### **‚ùå The Wrong Sequence (What We Did)**

```bash
# 1. Started working on Stripe integration in feature branch
git checkout -b feature/stripe-integration

# 2. Added Stripe models to schema.prisma locally
# - subscription_events table
# - subscriptions table  
# - Stripe fields in User model

# 3. ‚ùå Created migrations locally but never committed them
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_stripe_models
# This created tables in LOCAL database only

# 4. ‚ùå Somehow production database got Stripe tables
# (Possibly from manual deployment, different branch, or database restore)

# 5. ‚ùå Merged feature branch to main WITHOUT migrations
git checkout main
git merge feature/stripe-integration
# Code had Stripe models, but no migration files

# 6. ‚ùå Production deployment failed
# Error: "relation 'encrypted_user_data' already exists"
# Migration conflict between local and production
```

#### **‚úÖ The Correct Sequence (What We Should Have Done)**

```bash
# 1. Start feature branch
git checkout -b feature/stripe-integration

# 2. Sync with production schema FIRST
npx prisma db pull  # Get latest production schema
npx prisma generate

# 3. Add Stripe models to schema.prisma

# 4. Create and test migration locally
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_stripe_subscription_models
npx prisma migrate reset  # Test full migration cycle
npx prisma migrate deploy  # Verify it works

# 5. ‚úÖ COMMIT MIGRATION FILES WITH CODE
git add prisma/migrations/
git add prisma/schema.prisma
git add src/
git commit -m "feat: add Stripe subscription models + migration"
git push origin feature/stripe-integration

# 6. ‚úÖ Merge everything together
git checkout main
git merge feature/stripe-integration
# Now main has: code + schema + migrations

# 7. ‚úÖ Deploy with everything in sync
git push origin main
# CI/CD will: apply migrations first, then deploy code
```

#### **üö® How Feature Branch Database Conflicts Happen**

**Common Scenarios:**

1. **Local Development Without Committing Migrations**
   ```bash
   # ‚ùå WRONG: Create migration locally, never commit
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_stripe_models
   # Tables created in local DB, but migration files not in git
   
   # ‚ùå WRONG: Deploy code expecting tables that don't exist in production
   git push origin main  # Code deployed, but no migration files
   ```

2. **Production Database Gets Out of Sync**
   ```bash
   # ‚ùå WRONG: Someone deploys from wrong branch
   git checkout feature/stripe-integration
   # Deploy from feature branch (with Stripe models)
   # Then merge to main without the migrations
   ```

3. **Manual Database Changes**
   ```bash
   # ‚ùå WRONG: Manual SQL execution in production
   CREATE TABLE subscription_events (...);
   # But no migration file in git
   # Result: Schema drift
   ```

4. **Database Restore/Backup Issues**
   ```bash
   # ‚ùå WRONG: Restore database with different schema
   # Production DB has Stripe tables from backup
   # But migration history doesn't match
   ```

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Checklist for Feature Branches**

**Before Starting Feature Development:**
- [ ] **Sync with production schema**: `npx prisma db pull` ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Generate Prisma client**: `npx prisma generate` ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Verify clean state**: `npx prisma migrate status` ‚úÖ

**During Feature Development:**
- [ ] **Create migrations for schema changes**: `npx prisma migrate dev` ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Test migrations locally**: `npx prisma migrate reset` ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Verify migration works**: `npx prisma migrate deploy` ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Commit migration files**: Always commit `prisma/migrations/` ‚úÖ

**Before Merging Feature Branch:**
- [ ] **Migration files committed**: Check `git status` shows migration files ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Schema changes committed**: Check `git status` shows schema changes ‚úÖ
- [ ] **All tests passing**: Run tests with new schema ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Migration history clean**: `npx prisma migrate status` shows "up to date" ‚úÖ

**After Merging to Main:**
- [ ] **Migration files in main branch**: Verify `prisma/migrations/` contains new files ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Schema changes in main branch**: Verify `schema.prisma` has new models ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Deployment includes migrations**: CI/CD should run `npx prisma migrate deploy` ‚úÖ

#### **üí° Key Lessons from Stripe Incident**

1. **Feature Branch Isolation**: Database changes in feature branches must be committed
2. **Migration File Commitment**: Never develop without committing migration files
3. **Production Schema Sync**: Always sync with production before starting new features
4. **Complete Feature Delivery**: Code + Schema + Migrations must be delivered together
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Let deployment pipeline handle production migrations

#### **üîß Recovery Steps (If It Happens Again)**

```bash
# 1. Identify the drift
npx prisma migrate status
npx prisma db pull

# 2. Create missing migration files
npx prisma migrate dev --name fix_missing_tables

# 3. Test migration locally
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 4. Commit and deploy
git add prisma/migrations/
git commit -m "fix: add missing migration for existing tables"
git push origin main
```

**Remember**: Feature branch development requires extra care with database changes. Always commit migrations with code changes to prevent schema drift!
