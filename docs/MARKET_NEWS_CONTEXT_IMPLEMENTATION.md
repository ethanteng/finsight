# Financial Market News Context System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the Financial Market News Context system for Starter, Standard, and Premium tiers, providing AI-powered market context synthesis and tier-based access control. The system integrates with Polygon.io for Premium tier functionality, providing comprehensive market intelligence.

## Implementation Summary

### Database Schema
- **MarketNewsContext**: Stores AI-synthesized market context with metadata
- **MarketNewsHistory**: Tracks changes and provides audit trail
- Proper foreign key relationships and indexing

### Core Components

#### 1. MarketNewsAggregator (`src/market-news/aggregator.ts`)
- Collects data from FRED (economic indicators), Brave Search (market news), and Polygon.io (Premium tier)
- Implements source prioritization and data filtering
- Handles API rate limiting and error recovery
- Supports tier-based data access (Starter: FRED only, Standard: FRED + Brave Search, Premium: Polygon.io + all sources)

#### 2. MarketNewsSynthesizer (`src/market-news/synthesizer.ts`)
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to synthesize raw market data into actionable insights
- Implements tier-aware filtering and context generation
- Extracts key events and identifies market trends
- Provides structured, professional market summaries

#### 3. MarketNewsManager (`src/market-news/manager.ts`)
- Coordinates aggregator and synthesizer operations
- Handles database persistence and retrieval
- Manages manual overrides and admin controls
- Implements change tracking and history logging

### API Endpoints

#### Public Endpoints
- `GET /market-news/context/:tier` - Get current market context for a tier
- Returns structured market context with metadata

#### Admin Endpoints (require admin authentication)
- `PUT /admin/market-news/context/:tier` - Update market context manually
- `GET /admin/market-news/history/:tier` - Get market context history
- `POST /admin/market-news/refresh/:tier` - Force refresh market context
- All admin endpoints use `adminAuth` middleware for proper authorization

### Tier-Based Access Control

#### Starter Tier
- Access to FRED economic indicators only
- Basic market context with fundamental economic data
- No access to live market data or news search

#### Standard Tier
- Access to FRED economic indicators + Brave Search market news
- Comprehensive market context with economic and news data
- Enhanced AI synthesis with broader market perspective

#### Premium Tier ✅
- **Polygon.io Integration**: Complete market intelligence platform access

## Development Workflow Compliance

✅ **Feature Branch**: Created `feature/financial-market-news-context` from main
✅ **Database Migrations**: Proper Prisma migrations with rollback capability
✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage
✅ **Code Quality**: TypeScript with proper typing and error handling
✅ **Documentation**: Clear code comments and implementation summary
✅ **Git Workflow**: Clean commits with descriptive messages

## Environment Variable Configuration

### API Key Management

The system uses different API keys for different environments to ensure proper testing and production separation:

#### **Localhost Development**
- `.env`: `POLYGON_API_KEY` - Real production key for local development
- `.env.test`: `POLYGON_API_KEY` - Fake key for CI/CD tests

#### **Production (GitHub Actions)**
- `POLYGON_API_KEY` - Fake key for CI/CD tests
- `POLYGON_API_KEY_REAL` - Real production key

#### **Production (Render)**
- `POLYGON_API_KEY` - Real production key

This configuration ensures that:
- Local development uses real API keys for testing
- CI/CD tests use fake keys to avoid API costs
- Production uses real keys for actual functionality

### Environment Variable Logic

The system automatically selects the correct API key based on the environment:

```typescript
private getPolygonApiKey(): string | undefined {
  // In test environment, use the fake key
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test') {
    return process.env.POLYGON_API_KEY; // Fake key for tests
  }
  
  // In production (GitHub Actions), use the real key
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS) {
    return process.env.POLYGON_API_KEY_REAL; // Real key for production
  }
  
  // In production (Render), use the real key
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && !process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS) {
    return process.env.POLYGON_API_KEY; // Real key for Render
  }
  
  // In development (localhost), use the real key
  return process.env.POLYGON_API_KEY; // Real key for localhost
}
```

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Standard Tier (Current Implementation)
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_key
FRED_API_KEY_REAL=your_production_fred_key

# Premium Tier (Implemented)
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key
POLYGON_API_KEY_REAL=your_production_polygon_api_key

# Existing Keys (Fallback)
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY_REAL=your_production_alpha_vantage_key
```

## Performance Considerations
